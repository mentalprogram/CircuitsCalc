# CircuitsCalc
Circuits Calculator application first code

This is an application that will allow the user to quickly do calculations for electric circuits. This is the first piece of code, it
allows the user to do calutions for Ohm's law. 


Ohm's Law
- I = V/R
- R = R/I
- V = R*I

I intend to have the program in the future to be able to the calculations for all components of circuits. The targeted audience for 
the application is beginner electricians, students, etc.
